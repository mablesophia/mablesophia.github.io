Dear Dr. Irizarry,I am so pleased with the availability of your online data science courses and I am very excited about this proposal to develop additional materials. As you know, many of the biomedical sciences are becoming much more data-driven. Unfortunately, like many researchers in this field, I had little training in statistics or computer science. Properly training the scientific workforce for this new era of big data is clearly important.Your use of the edX platform to freely distribute the content created by the highly qualified team that you have put together has already proven to be an incredibly valuable resource for me as a graduate student/postdoctoral fellow in biology. [GIVE SPECIFICS ABOUT RESEARCH AND WHAT SKILLS WERE HELPFUL] These materials have allowed me to improve my research skills in my rapidly changing field.In my capacity as XXXX, I am very much appreciative of the need your data science courses have filled. It has already proven useful in my research, and I enthusiastically support the development of additional materials.
