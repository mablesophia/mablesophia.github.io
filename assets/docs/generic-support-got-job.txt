Dear Dr. Irizarry,I am so pleased with the availability of your online data science courses and I am very excited about this proposal to develop additional materials. As you know, many of the biomedical sciences are becoming much more data-driven. These courses furthered my training in statistics and computer science, allowing me to get a job in bioinformatics. Without these courses, like many researchers in this field, I would not have had the skills needed for this type of work. Your use of the edX platform to freely distribute the content created by the highly qualified team that you have put together has already proven to be an incredibly valuable resource for me as a job seeker. [GIVE SPECIFICS ABOUT WORK AND WHAT SKILLS WERE HELPFUL] These materials have allowed me to build my skills and improve my job prospects.In my capacity as XXXX, I am very much appreciative of the need your data science courses have filled. It has already proven useful for my career, and I enthusiastically support the development of additional materials.
