Dear Dr. Irizarry,I am so pleased with the availability of your online data science courses and I am very excited about this proposal to develop additional materials. As you know, many of the biomedical sciences are becoming much more data-driven. Unfortunately, it is common to have researchers in this field that are not trained in statistics or computer science. Properly training the scientific workforce for this new era of big data is clearly an urgent need.Your use of the edX platform to freely distribute the content created by the highly qualified team that you have put together has already proven to be an incredibly valuable resource for me as an educator. As an educator, these materials have been invaluable to me in multiple ways: in brushing up my own skills, in providing materials for use in my own teaching, and in offering additional practice to my students.In my capacity as XXXX, I am very much appreciative of the need your data science courses have filled. It has already proven useful in my teaching, and I enthusiastically support the development of additional materials.
