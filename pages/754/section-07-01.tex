\section{Projection Pursuit}
One solution is projection-pursuit. It assumes a model of the form
\[
f(X_1,\dots,X_n) = \sum_{j=1}^p f_j\{\bg{\alpha}_j'\bX\}
\]
where $\bg{\alpha}_j ' \bX$ denotes a one dimensional projection of the
vector $(X_1,\dots,X_p)'$ and $f_j$ is an arbitrary function of this
projection. 


The model builds up the regression surface by estimating these
univariate regressions along carefully chosen projections defined by
the $\bg{\alpha}_k$. Thus for $K=1$ and $p=2$ the regression surface
looks like a corrugated sheet and is constant in the directions
orthogonal to $\bf{\alpha}_k$.

If you don't see how this solves the problem of dimensionality, the
next section will help you understand.
