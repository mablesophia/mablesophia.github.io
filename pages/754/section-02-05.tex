\section{Linear smoothers}
Most of the smoother presented here are linear smoothers which means
that the fit at any point $x_0$ can be written as 
\[
s(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n S_{j}(x) y_j.
\]

In practice we usually have the model 
\[
Y_i = f(X_i) + \epsilon_i
\]
and we have observations $\{(x_i, y_i)\}$. Many times it is the vector
${\mathbf f} = \{f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)\}'$ we are after. In this case
the vector of estimates $\hat{\mathbf f} =
\{\hat{f}(x_1),\dots,\hat{f}(x_n)\}'$ can be written as
\[
\hat{\mathbf f} = \bS \by
\]
with $\bS$ a matrix with the i,j-th entry $S_{j}(x_i)$. We will call
$\hat{\mathbf f}$ the {\it smooth}.

This makes it easy to figure out things like the variance of
$\hat{\f}$ since 
\[
\var[\bS \by] = \bS \var[\by] \bS' 
\]
which in the case of IID data is $\sigma^2 \bS\bS'$.
