\section{Parametric smoother}
These are what you have seen already. We force a function defined by
``few'' parameters on the data and use something like least squares to
find the ``best'' estimates for the parameters. 

For example, a regression line computed with least squares can be
thought of as a smoother. In this case $S[\by|\bx](x_0) =
(1 \, x_0) \, (\bX'\bX)^{-1}\bX'\by$ with $\bX$ a design matrix containing a
column of 1's and $\bx$ ({\tt cbind(1,x)}).
 

The lack of flexibility of these types of smoother can make them
provide misleading results.
