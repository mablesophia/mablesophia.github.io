\chapter{Introduction to Time Series Analysis}
A {\sl time series} is a collection of observations made
sequentially in time. Examples are daily mortality counts,
particulate air pollution measurements, and temperature data.
Figure 1 shows these for the city of Chicago from 1987 to 1994.
The public health question is whether daily mortality is
associated with particle levels, controlling for temperature.

We represent time series measurements with $Y_1, \dots, Y_T$
where $T$ is the total number of measurements. In order to analyze
a time series, it is useful to set down a statistical model in the
form of a {\sl stochastic process}. A stochastic process can be
described as a statistical phenomenon
that evolves in time. While most statistical problems are
concerned with estimating properties of a population from a
sample, in time series analysis there is a different situation.
Although it might be possible to vary the length of the observed
sample, it is usually impossible to make multiple observations at
any single time (for example, one can't observe today's mortality
count more than once). This makes the conventional statistical
procedures, based on large sample estimates, inappropriate.
Stationarity is a convenient assumption that permits us to
describe the statistical properties of a time series.
