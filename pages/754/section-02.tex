\chapter{Overview of various smoothers}
A scatter plot smoother is a tool for finding structure in a scatter
plot: $(x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_n,y_n)$

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose that we consider $\by = (y_1,\dots,y_n)'$ as the {\it response
measurements} and $\bx = (x_1,\dots,x_n)'$ as the {\it design points}.

\item We can think of $\bx$ and $\by$ as outcomes of random variable $X$
and $Y$. However, for scatter plot smoothers we don't
really need stochastic assumptions, it can be considered as a
descriptive tool.

\item A scatter plot smoother can be defined as a function (remember
  the general definition of {\it function}) of $\bx$ and
$\by$ with domain at least containing the values in $\bx$: $s =
\bS[\by | \bx]$. 
 
\item There is usually a ``recipe'' that gives $s(x_0)$, which is the function
$\bS[\by | \bx]$ evaluated at $x_0$,  for all $x_0$. We will be
calling $x_0$ the {\it target value} when we giving the recipe. Note:
Some recipes don't give an $s(x_0)$ for all $x_0$, but only for the
$x$'s included in $\bx$. 

\end{itemize}

Note we will call the vector $\{s(x_1),\dots,s(x_n)\}'$ as {\it the smooth}.

Here is a stupid example: If we assume a random desing model and take
expectations over the empirical distribution $\hat{F}$, defined by the
observations, we have for any $x_0 \in \{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$, 
\[
E_{\hat{F}}[Y|X=x_0] = \ave \{ y_i; x_i = x_0\}. 
\]
Define $s(x_0)=\E_{\hat{F}}[Y|X=x_0]$. What happens if the $x_i$ are
unique? 

Since $Y$ and $X$ are, in general,  non-categorical we don't expect to
find many replicates at any given value of $X$. This means that we
could end up with the data again, $s(x_0)=y_0$ for all $x_0$. Not very
smooth!

Note: For convenience, through out this chapter,  we assume that the
data are sorted by $X$. 

Many smoothers force  $s(x)$ to be a smooth function of $x$. This is
a fancy way of saying we think data points that are close (in $x$)
should have roughly the same expectation.
