\section{Smoothing and Penalized Least Squares }
In Section 4.4.1 we saw that the smoothing spline solution to a
penalized least squares is a linear smoother.

Using the notation of Section 4.4.1, we can write the penalized
criterion as 
\[
(\by - \bB\bg{\theta})'(\by - \bB\bg{\theta}) +
\lambda\bg{\theta}'\bg{\Omega}\bg{\theta}
\]

Setting derivatives with respect to $\bg{\theta}$ equal to 0 gives
the estimating equation:
\[
(\bB'\bB + \lambda\bg{\Omega})\bg{\theta} = \bB'\by
\]
the $\hat{\bg{\theta}}$ that solves this equation will give us the
estimate $\hat{\g} = \bB \hat{\bg{\theta}}$.


Write:
\[
\hat{\g} = \bB \bg{\theta} = \bB(\bB'\bB + \lambda \bg{\Omega})^{-1}
\bB'\by =  ({\mathbf I} + \lambda {\mathbf K})^{-1}\by
\]
where ${\mathbf K} = \bB'^{-} \bg{\Omega} \bB^{-}$. 

Notice we can
write the penalized criterion as
\[
(\by - \g)'(\by - \g) + \lambda \g' {\mathbf K} \g
\]

If we plot the rows of this linear smoother we will see that it is
like a kernel smoother.

Notice that for any linear smoother  with a symmetric and nonnegative
definite $\bS$, i.e. there $\bS^{-}$ exists, then 
we can argue in reverse: $\hat{\f}=\bS\by$ is the value that minimizes the
penalized least squares criteria of the form
\[
(\by - \f)'(\by - \f) + \f'(\bS^{-} - I)\f.
\]

Some of the smoothers presented in this class are not symmetrical but
are close. In fact for many of them one can show that asymptotically
they are symmetric.
