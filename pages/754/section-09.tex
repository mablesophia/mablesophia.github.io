\chapter{Model Selection}
Suppose we observe a realization of a random variable $Y$, with
distribution defined by a parameter $\bb$
\begin{equation}
\label{gdef}
\prod_{\bx_i \in N_0} f(y_i; \bx_i,\bb) \equiv
f_\bY(\by ;\bX,\bb)  
\end{equation}
where $\by$ is the observed response associated with the
covariates $\bX$ and 
$\bb \in \mathbb{R}^P$ is a $P \times 1$ parameter vector. 

We are interested in estimating $\bb$. Suppose that before
doing so, we need to choose from amongst $P$
competing models, generated by simply restricting the
general parameter space $R^P$ in which $\bb$ lies.

In terms of the
parameters, we represent {\sl the full model} with $P$ parameters as:
\[
\mbox{Model(P): } f_\bY(\by ;\bx,\bb_P),
  \bb_P = (\beta_1,\dots,\beta_p,\beta_{p+1},\dots,\beta_P)'.
\]
We denote the ``true value'' of the parameter vector $\bb$ with
$\bb^*$. 

Akaike (1977)
formulates the problem of statistical model identification as one of
selecting a model $f_\bY(\by;\bx,\bb_p)$
based on the  
observations from that distribution, where the particular restricted
model is defined by the constraint $\beta_{p+1} = \beta_{p+2} = \dots
= \beta_{P} = 0$, so that 
\begin{equation}
\label{modelpdef}
\mbox{Model(p): } f_\bY(\by;\bx,\bb_p),
\bb_p =  (\beta_1,\dots,\beta_p,0,\dots,0)' 
\end{equation}
We will refer to $p$ as the {\sl number of parameters} and to
$\Omega_p$ as the sub-space of $\mathbb{R}^P$ defined by restriction
(\ref{modelpdef}). For each $p=1,\dots,P$, we may assume model(p) to
estimate the non-zero 
components of the vector $\bb^*$. We are interested in a 
criterion that helps us chose amongst these $P$ competing estimates.

In this Chapter we consider 3 methods for model selection.
