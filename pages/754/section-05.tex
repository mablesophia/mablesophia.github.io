\chapter{Resampling methods: Bias, Variance, and their trade-off}
We have defined various smoothers and nonparametric estimation
techniques. In classical statistical theory we usually assume that the
underlying model generating the data is in the family of models we
are considering. For nonparametrics this assumptions is relaxed and
asymptotic and finite sample bias and variance 
estimates are not always easy to find in closed form. In this Chapter
we discuss some resampling methods that are commonly used to get
approximations of bias, variance, confidence intervals, etc... 

In particular we will look at the problem of choosing smoothing
parameters. Remember how most of the smoothers we have defined have
some parameter that controls the smoothness of the final smooth or
curve estimate. For kernel smoothers we defined the scale parameter, for
local regression we defined the span or bandwidth, and for smoothing
splines we had the penalty term. We will call all of these {\it
the  smoothing parameter} and denote it with $\lambda$. It should be
clear from the context which of the specific smoothing parameters we
are referring to.
