\chapter{Splines}

Through-out this section, the regression function $f$ will depend on a
single, real-valued predictor $X$ ranging over some possibly infinite
interval of the real line, $I \subset \mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the
(mean) dependence of $Y$ on $X$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{fdef}
f(x) = \E(Y|X=x), x \in I \subset \mathbb{R}.
\end{equation}
For spline models, estimate definitions and their properties 
are more easily characterized in the context of linear spaces.
