\section{Bin smoothers}
A bin smoother, also known as a regressogram, mimics a categorical
smoother by partitioning the predicted value into disjoint and
exhaustive regions, then averaging the response in each
region. Formally, we choose cut-points $c_0 < \dots <c_K$ where $c_0 =
-\infty$ and $c_K = \infty$, and define
\[
R_k = \{i; c_k \leq x_i < c_{k+1} \}; k=0,\dots,K
\]
the indexes of the data points in each region. Then $S[\by|\bx]$ is
given by 
\[
s(x_0) = \ave_{i \in R_k}\{ y_i \} \mbox{ if } x_0 \in R_k
\]

Notice that the bin smoother will have discontinuities.
